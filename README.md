# Purpose
Contains subrepositories of all relevant C/C++ experience I have publically.

## 271sp24
Contains work in C for: 
- hw0: Radix Sort for C arrays
- hw1: Code which generates a buddhabrot, multithreaded using pthread. Managed to find orbits of points incredibly close to the edge, generating some really cool outputs, with 
orbits that could only be found on incredibly efficient algorithms.
- snek: Snake game with client/server capabilites, using a double ended circular queue to represent the snake, ensuring O(1) insertion from front and back, as well as O(1) access time.

## C-Portfolio
Contains work from my Data Structures and Algorithms class in C++. Includes: 
- Linked List
- Quicksort
- Recursive 3d maze solving
- HashMap (w/ quadratic probing)
- Stacks, Queues, and Deques

## c_data_structures
Contains some pure C data structures, including:
- Linked List
- BST
- Dynamic array
- Sorting
